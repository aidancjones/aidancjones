        <p class="abouth2">In 2016, my curiosity led me to take a digital art and design course that walked everyone through the basics of Adobe Creative Cloud. I quickly fell in love and took the same class every semester until I graduated. During that time, I focused on designing logos and graphics for clients, friends, and family. As I  transitioned into my time at the University of Colorado Boulder, I began majoring in strategic communication with a minor in creative technology design (CTD). I am continually gaining a deeper understanding of the concepts which underlie the creative process.  </p>
