  <p>Persea americana is a tree that grows to 20 m (66 ft), with alternately
    arranged leaves 12–25 cm (5–10 in) long. Panicles of flowers with deciduous
    bracts arise from new growth or the axils of leaves.[9] The flowers are
    inconspicuous, greenish-yellow, 5–10 mm (3⁄16–3⁄8 in) wide.</p>

  <h2 id="History-Section">History</h2>
  <p>The earliest residents of northern coastal Peru were living in temporary
    camps in an ancient wetland and eating avocados, along with chilies,
    mollusks, sharks, birds, and sea lions. The oldest discovery of an
    avocado pit comes from Coxcatlan Cave, dating from around 9,000 to 10,000
    years ago. Other caves in the Tehuacan Valley from around the same
    time period also show early evidence for the presence and consumption of
    avocado. There is evidence for avocado use at Norte Chico civilization
    sites in Peru by at least 3,200 years ago and at Caballo Muerto in Peru
    from around 3,800 to 4,500 years ago.</p>

  <h2 id="Etymology-Section">Etymology</h2>
  <p>The word avocado comes from the Spanish aguacate, which in turn comes
    from the Nahuatl word āhuacatl derived from the proto-Aztecan, 'avocado'.
    The modern English name comes from a rendering of the Spanish aguacate
    as avogato. The earliest known written use in English is attested from
    1697 as avogato pear, a term which later underwent folk etymology to
    become alligator pear.</p>

  <h2 id="Cultivation-Section">Cultivation</h2>
  <img alt="Picture of Avocado" src="img/AvocadoCultivation.jpg">

  <p>As a subtropical species, avocados need a climate without frost and with
    little wind. High winds reduce the humidity, dehydrate the flowers, and
    affect pollination. When even a mild frost occurs, premature fruit drop may
    occur, although the 'Hass' cultivar can tolerate temperatures down to −1 °C.
    Several cold-hardy varieties are planted in the region of Gainesville,
    Florida, which survive temperatures as low as −6.5 °C (20 °F) with only minor
    leaf damage. The trees also need well-aerated soils, ideally more than
    1 m deep.</p>

  <h2 id="Production-Section">Production</h2>
  <img alt="Picture of Avocado" src="img/AvocadoProduction.jpg">
  <p>In 2019, world production of avocados was 7.2 million tonnes, led by
    Mexico with 32% (2.3 million tonnes) of the total (table). Other major
    producers were Dominican Republic, Peru, Colombia, and Indonesia, together
    producing 31% of the world total. Despite market effects of the 2020
    COVID-19 pandemic, volume production of avocados in Mexico increased by
    40% over 2019 levels.</p>
